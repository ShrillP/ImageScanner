# ImageScanner
This is a python project that turns an image of a page or receipt and scans it automatically. Unlike traditional phone applications that require you to take a picture of your sheet in a birds-eye view, this program automatically does that so you can just snap a pic and send it into the application. 
# Usage
From your terminal pointing to this project directory, type "python scan.py --image [path to your image]" (ignore quotations).
